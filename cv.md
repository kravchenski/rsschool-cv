### About myself:

My name is `Max`. I am `16` years old. I am from `Grodno`. My goal is to become a developer👨‍💻 and to work in the `international IT company🏢`.

Although  I have a deep passion for learning and exploring new ideas. I actively participate in various competitions where I can show my `English` and `IT` skills. 

__In terms of technical skills__, I have a solid foundation in `HTML`, `CSS`,`Java` and `JavaScript`. I also have knowledge in `Python` which allows me to create various projects: `chatbots in Telegram`. I constantly use `GitHub` to save my projects. Additionally, I am proficient in utilizing `Git` _for version control_, and I am familiar with popular _development tools_ such as `VS Code`, `IntelliJ IDEA`, and `PyCharm`. Furthermore, I have experience working with _design tools_ 🎨 such as `Figma`, `Adobe Illustrator`, and `Canva`, enabling me to create visually appealing _interfaces_, _presentations_ and _beautiful slide-shows_.

Last year I started using `ChatGPT` and finding out the latest news📰 about `neural networks`. It helps me to find the necessary information when I create projects very quickly.

__With a strong drive for self-improvement and passion for programming🖥️🖱️ and  neural networks🤖, I am excited to embark on this journey🚢 to achieve my goals🎯 in the IT industry💻.__
